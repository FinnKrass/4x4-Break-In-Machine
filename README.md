# Break-In-Machine-Finn
My rendition of some of the break in machines that are available.

This is basically a higher capacity break in machine than that of keekeens (I would highly recommend checking his out https://github.com/keekeen/MX-Switch-Break-In-Machine) using some of the ideas from FengStudios 4 x 4 machine.
I want to emphasise that this has a lot of compensation for print tolerances, and any of the holes for bearings etc could differ for you depending on your machine so please take this into account.

Here is the BoM:

Prints:
  - 1* Machine Housing - best suited to pla+ or petg, a prototype I did in standard pla was pretty flimsy
  - 2* Actuation Plate - any material really, I did pla+ and that worked without a single issue
  - 1* Scotch Yoke - I personally printed 30 of these since they kept breaking. Then I decided to print at 0.1 layer height and now the motor seems like it runs better and there hasn't been a single break.
  - 2* Switch plates - Would say print these in whatever, use lightning infill at a higher percent if you really want to speed these up.

Items: I recommend buying extras of all
  - 2* 6mm x 150mm smooth rod (example https://www.makerstore.com.au/product/hard-rod-6/ )
  - 4* 6mm Linear bearings (example https://www.makerstore.com.au/product/bear-lm6uu/ )
  - 2* 0306 needle bearing (example https://appliedau.com.au/product-details/bearings/roller-bearings/needle-roller-bearings/hk-0306-tn/9e46f232-d7c0-11ea-9e6c-567e73c68856)
  - As many as you want* 1:48 TT Geared Motor 3-6v OR 1:90 All Metal Gearbox TT Motor. Don't waste your time and money on the cheap ones from amazon, you will get anywhere between 5 minutes and 3 hours of use before they die https://core-electronics.com.au/dc-gearbox-motor-tt-motor-200rpm-3-to-6vdc.html)
  - 1* M3x6 Screw
  - 2* M3x20 Screw
  - 2* M3x10 Screw
  - 2* M3x14 Screw

I now just printed a more final version of the machine at .15 and .1 layer height depending on the required strength for the part.

I used a power supply unit which allows me to control the voltage of the machine, at around 7.5-8v I was getting 450 rpm based off counting audio peaks and between 120 and 250 when at 6v depending on which motor.

I would implore others to use this as a base of reference, this is so far from a complete and thorough/reliable design. It definitely works, and it works well at that, but it isn't end user friendly at all which was not the intention of this project!!

Assembly is pretty straight forward.
  - Place the scotch yoke on the motor, screw it into place with the M3x6 screw and then attach the 0306 bearings on either end with M3x10 screws
  - Secure the motor to the housing with 2 M3x20 and 1 M3x14
  - Insert the 6mm Linear bearings into the plates, I used a small hammer and tapped them lightly to ensure they were snug and fully in. They did end up coming loose after a couple days of using the machine so I just put them in so that they were in the socket but only the tip, surrounded it with superglue, pushed the whole thing in and let it dry. 
  - Insert smooth rod 1/3 into the guide holes on each side then place the first plate on, push the rod in 2/3 and insert the second plate, then push the rod the full way. I used a hammer to lightly tap the rods in.
