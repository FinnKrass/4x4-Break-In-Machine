# Break-In-Machine-Finn

This was just sorta a project that I took on for fun, I don't think that this is perfect by any stretch of the word but it is functional and it does break the switches in. There's a heap that I wanted to add to this (caps to go over the linear bearings to secure them, off center actuation mechanism, better motor compatibility so that there was no need for the shitty ones that keep burning out), but it's taken up so much time already, and printing parts to test out a new feature can take 45 hours, so I'm gonna take a break and probably come back and start fresh with something along the lines of what flehrad designed. My point being, this is here so that people can use it as a base for future stuff, or just for people to print a basic machine that works out of the gate, it probably won't be updated very much though. 

Here is the BoM:

Prints:
  - 1* Machine Housing - best suited to pla+ or petg, a prototype I did in standard pla was pretty flimsy
  - 2* Actuation Plates - any material really, I did pla+ and that worked without a single issue
  - 1* Scotch Yoke - I personally printed 30 of these since they kept breaking even when printed with petg. Then I decided to print at 0.1 layer height and now the motor seems like it runs better and there hasn't been a single failure.
  - 2* Switch plates - Would say print these in whatever, use lightning infill at a higher percent if you really want to speed these up.

Items: I recommend buying extras of all
  - 2* 6mm x 150mm smooth rod (example https://www.makerstore.com.au/product/hard-rod-6/ )
  - 4* 6mm Linear bearings (example https://www.makerstore.com.au/product/bear-lm6uu/ )
  - 2* 0306 needle bearing (example https://appliedau.com.au/product-details/bearings/roller-bearings/needle-roller-bearings/hk-0306-tn/9e46f232-d7c0-11ea-9e6c-567e73c68856)
  - As many as you want* 1:48 TT Geared Motor 3-6v OR 1:90 All Metal Gearbox TT Motor. Don't waste your time and money on the cheap ones from amazon, you will get anywhere between 5 minutes and 3 hours of use before they die https://core-electronics.com.au/dc-gearbox-motor-tt-motor-200rpm-3-to-6vdc.html)
  - 1* M3x6 Screw
  - 2* M3x20 Screw
  - 2* M3x10 Screw
  - 2* M3x14 Screw

I just printed a more final version of the machine at .15 and .1 layer height depending on the required strength for the part and that has been the best performing one I have made so far.
-------------
I used a power supply unit which allows me to control the voltage of the machine, I saw the thing get up to a maximum speed of 650rpm but I wouldn't do that or you'll burn the motor out in under an hour, I did so just to see how long it could run.
-------------
I would implore others to use this as a base of reference, this is so so far from a completed and thorough/reliable design. It definitely works, and it works well at that, but it isn't end user friendly at all which was not the intention of this project!!
-------------
Assembly is pretty straight forward.
  - Place the scotch yoke on the motor, screw it into place with the M3x6 screw and then attach the 0306 bearings on either end with M3x10 screws
  - Secure the motor to the housing with 2 M3x20 and 1 M3x14
  - Insert the 6mm Linear bearings into the plates, I used a small hammer and tapped them lightly to ensure they were snug and fully in. They did end up coming loose after a couple days of using the machine so I just put them in so that they were in the socket but only the tip, surrounded it with superglue, pushed the whole thing in and let it dry. 
  - Insert smooth rod 1/3 into the guide holes on each side then place the first plate on, push the rod in 2/3 and insert the second plate, then push the rod the full way. I used a hammer to lightly tap the rods in.
