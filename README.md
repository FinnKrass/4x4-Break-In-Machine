# Break-In-Machine-Finn
My rendition of some of the break in machines that are available.

This is basically a higher capacity break in machine than that of keekeens (I would highly recommend checking his out https://github.com/keekeen/MX-Switch-Break-In-Machine) using some of the ideas from FengStudios 4 x 4 machine.
I want to emphasise that this has a lot of compensation for print tolerances, and any of the holes for bearings etc could differ for you depending on your machine so please take this into account.

Here is the BoM:

Prints:
  - 1* 4 x 4 Machine Housing - best suited to pla+ or petg, a prototype I did in standard pla had multiple failures
  - 2* 4 x 4 Actuation Plate - any material really, I did pla+ and that worked without a single issue
  - 1* Scotch Yoke - I made this better suited for FDM printing by widening the hole for the motor stem

Items: I would say purchase extra of each for backup
  - 2* 6mm x 150mm smooth rod (example https://www.makerstore.com.au/product/hard-rod-6/ )
  - 4* 6mm Linear bearings (example https://www.makerstore.com.au/product/bear-lm6uu/ )
  - 2* 0306 needle bearing (example https://appliedau.com.au/product-details/bearings/roller-bearings/needle-roller-bearings/hk-0306-tn/9e46f232-d7c0-11ea-9e6c-567e73c68856)
  - 1* 1:48 TT Geared Motor 3-6v (example https://core-electronics.com.au/dc-gearbox-motor-tt-motor-200rpm-3-to-6vdc.html)
  - 1* M3x6 Screw
  - 2* M3x20 Screw 
  - 2* M3x10 Screw
  - 2* M3x14 Screw

Print settings I did all of mine with 0.2mm layer height and that worked well for both strength and tolerances.

I bought about 10 motors as this means you are able to run for longer periods of time with more motors available in the case that they break, you can find them for a few dollars.

It is still good to care for the motor and give it breaks as a) don't want anyone burning their house down and b) waste of motor that would be fine with better care.
Furthermore I used a power supply unit which allows me to control the voltage of the machine, at around 7.5-8v I was getting 450 rpm based off counting audio peaks.

I would implore others to use this as a base of reference as I had a blast working on designing this myself, but for those who don't want to do that then use this however!!

Assembly is pretty straight forward. 
  - Place the scotch yoke on the motor, screw it into place with the M3x6 screw and then attach the 0306 bearings on either end with M3x10 screws 
  - Secure the motor to the housing with 2 M3x20 and 1 M3x14 
  - Insert the 6mm Linear bearings into the plates, I used a small hammer and tapped them lightly to ensure they were snug and fully in. 
  - Insert smooth rod 1/3 into the guide holes on each side then place the first plate on, push the rod in 2/3 and insert the second plate, then push the rod the full way. I used a hammer to lightly tap the rods in.
